## 1. Executive Summary

Workflow V1 is a **document-driven, gated engineering workflow** for this
repository (Trydos — a Flutter mobile app combining a marketplace, real-time
chat/calls (Agora webview + CallKit), and stories, built on Clean Architecture,
BLoC + hydrated_bloc, dio, get_it+injectable, and dartz). Every change moves through a fixed sequence of seven lifecycle stages, each
producing one Markdown artifact under `.claude/_specs/<ticket>/`, with two mandatory
human review gates before and after implementation. After successful verification,
delivery to GitHub is a **manual step** — the developer commits, pushes, and opens
the PR by hand; it is not a command, not a lifecycle stage, and performs no state
transition.

The workflow's defining property: **one ticket's workflow state lives in exactly
one place** — `.claude/_specs/<ticket>/ticket.md > state` (ADR-003) — and the repository
itself (artifacts + git) is the source of truth. Each lifecycle slash
commands reads that state, validates the transition against a canonical state
machine, does its work, and writes the new state back. No state is ever inferred
from which files exist.

Two execution modes exist: **`standard`** (normal work, one reviewer approval)
and **`high_risk`** (auth/session & token storage, api/network & `ServerName`,
composition root & `main.dart` init order, persisted hydrated-BLoC state shape,
calls/push, wallet/order money surfaces, config/secrets, generated code, or
wide-blast-radius work — including registering a new **app-wide** BLoC — with one
non-author approval + mandatory ADR + rollback rehearsal). A third mode, `fast`,
is **deferred and not selectable in V1**.

An optional, **read-only** ClickUp intake can seed a new ticket's title,
description, and link from an existing ClickUp task. Nothing is ever written back
to ClickUp.

GitHub is available only as a delivery surface. The developer manually commits and
pushes the branch, opens the PR in GitHub's web UI, and records the URL in
`ticket.md > links.github`, but GitHub PR status, review state, checks, merge
state, and comments are never read back into workflow state.

## 2. Workflow Goals

Why this workflow exists (from `CLAUDE.md` "Mission" and "Small-change
philosophy"):

- **Small, reviewed, verifiable changes.** Every change is the smallest one that
  satisfies its acceptance criteria, reviewed before code is written, and
  individually verifiable afterward.
- **No improvised scope.** One ticket = one focused outcome. Anything larger is
  split. Scope growth beyond the approved spec/plan is a hard-stop.
- **Read-only first, mutate last.** Investigation (research/spec/plan/review) is
  non-mutating; source is touched only during `implement`, and only files the
  plan named.
- **Protect the high-risk paths.** High-risk paths (`project-config.yaml > high_risk_paths`:
  auth/session & token storage, api/network + `ServerName`, the composition root
  and `main.dart`'s ordered init, persisted hydrated-BLoC state, calls & push,
  wallet/order money surfaces, config/secrets, and generated code) are never
  modified by workflow/governance work and only by an approved `high_risk`
  implement stage.
- **Traceability and reversibility.** Acceptance criteria carry stable IDs that
  thread spec → verify; every change is reversible and tied to a reviewed plan.

## 3. Core Principles

1. **`ticket.md` is canonical (ADR-003).** `.claude/_specs/<ticket>/ticket.md > state`
   is the *only* authoritative workflow state. Stage artifacts may carry a
   *local* `status` for their own progress but never own workflow state.
2. **The repository is the source of truth.** State, history, decisions, and
   evidence live in versioned files under `.claude/_specs/` and in git. External systems
   (ClickUp/GitHub) are *links* or delivery surfaces, never the authority.
3. **Reviewer-owned gates.** `/review` (before implementation) and `/verify`
   (closure) are owned by the **reviewer** role — a qualified person who is **not**
   the ticket's author. These gates are never skipped, in any mode.
4. **AI is advisory only.** An AI agent may draft artifacts and run author
   commands, but it is **never an approval authority**. Gate decisions
   (`APPROVED` / `CHANGES_REQUESTED` / `REJECTED`, and PASSED/FAILED sign-off)
   are made by a human reviewer.
5. **Separation of duties.** The reviewer at a gate must not be the author of the
   work under review. (Self-review is configurable for `standard` only, and is
   currently **disabled** — see §4 and §7.)
6. **Atomic transitions.** Every command validates fully *before* writing. On any
   precondition failure it writes nothing — no partial artifacts, no half
   transitions.
7. **One canonical state machine.** Allowed transitions are defined once in
   `project-config.yaml > lifecycle`; `blocked` is an orthogonal flag, not a
   state; `closed` is terminal.

## 4. Roles and Responsibilities

Four roles exist (`project-config.yaml > roles`). The legacy `em` actor seen in
older artifacts maps to `reviewer` (for gates) or `workflow_owner` (for
governance).

### Workflow Owner — governance, not per-ticket
Owns workflow evolution, governance decisions, escalations, and cross-project
issues. **Does not** sign off on individual tickets. Is *eligible* to serve as a
reviewer, including on `high_risk` tickets, but the workflow never *requires*
Workflow Owner participation on a given ticket.

### Reviewer — the gate authority
Owns the `/review` and `/verify` gates for a ticket. May be any qualified team
member (Developer, Senior, Tech Lead, Project Lead, or the Workflow Owner) **who
is not the ticket's author**. Records `APPROVED` / `CHANGES_REQUESTED` /
`REJECTED` at `/review` and the PASSED/FAILED sign-off at `/verify`. For
`high_risk`, the reviewer must be someone other than the plan author (never
self-review) and an ADR must be referenced.

### Developer — ticket execution owner
Authors and runs the author commands: `/start-ticket`, `/research`, `/spec`,
`/plan`, and `/implement`. Owns the ticket's artifacts, the implementation branch,
and the **manual** delivery handoff (commit + push + open PR by hand after closure).
Cannot approve their own work at a gate (separation of duties).

### AI Agent — assistant only
Assists across stages within the rules in `CLAUDE.md` (drafting research, spec,
plan, implement artifacts; running author commands). **Never holds approval
authority** at `/review` or `/verify`; those decisions are the human reviewer's.

### Ownership matrix — who invokes each command

| Command | Invoked by | Gate? | Approval authority |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/start-ticket` | Developer / AI Agent | no | — |
| `/research` | Developer / AI Agent | no | — |
| `/spec` | Developer / AI Agent | no | — |
| `/plan` | Developer / AI Agent | no | — |
| `/review` | **Reviewer** | **yes** | Reviewer (human) |
| `/implement` | Developer / AI Agent | no | — |
| `/verify` | **Reviewer** | **yes** | Reviewer (human) |

(Delivery to GitHub after `/verify` is a manual git step, not a command, so it has
no row here.)

### Ownership matrix — who owns each decision/asset

| Decision / asset | Owner |
|---|---|
| Ticket workflow state (`ticket.md > state`) | Whichever command performs the transition; the *record* is canonical in `ticket.md` |
| Plan approval (`APPROVED`/`CHANGES_REQUESTED`/`REJECTED`) | Reviewer |
| Verification sign-off (PASSED/FAILED) | Reviewer |
| Implementation branch `ticket/<slug>` | Developer |
| GitHub PR delivery (manual git commit + push + open PR; `links.github`) | Developer; metadata remains in `ticket.md`, pasted in by hand |
| Mode selection (`standard`/`high_risk`) | Developer at intake; escalated to Workflow Owner if disputed |
| ADR for `high_risk` | Developer authors; Reviewer requires it at `/review` |
| Workflow rules / governance | Workflow Owner |

## 5. End-to-End Ticket Lifecycle

Canonical states (`project-config.yaml > lifecycle`). `blocked` is **not** a
state — it is an orthogonal flag (`status: blocked`) on a non-terminal state.
`closed` is terminal (no reopen; open a new ticket).

```
draft
  → ready-for-research        (/research)
  → research-complete         (/spec)
  → spec-complete             (/plan, initial)
  → plan-complete → approved  (/review, APPROVED)
  → implementation-in-progress (/implement, initial)
  → implemented               (/implement, complete)
  → verified → closed         (/verify, PASSED)
```

Back-edges and exits that currently exist:
- `/review` **CHANGES_REQUESTED** → stays `spec-complete`; revise via `/plan`
  (revision) then re-`/review`.
- `/review` **REJECTED** → `spec-complete → closed` (terminal).
- `/implement` **blocked** → stays `implementation-in-progress`,
  `status: blocked`; resume via `/implement`.
- `/verify` **FAILED** → `implemented → implementation-in-progress`,
  `status: blocked`; fix via `/implement` (resume), then re-`/verify`.

Step-by-step (happy path, `standard` mode):

1. **Intake** — `/start-ticket <slug> "<title>"` creates `.claude/_specs/<slug>/` with
   `ticket.md` (`state: draft`) and `intake.md`. The author fills `intake.md` and
   marks **Readiness Status: READY**.
2. **Research** — `/research <slug>` performs read-only repo discovery, writes
   `research.md`, advances `draft → ready-for-research`.
3. **Spec** — `/spec <slug>` validates research, writes `spec.md` with stable
   acceptance-criteria IDs (`AC-1`, `AC-2`, …), advances
   `ready-for-research → research-complete`.
4. **Plan** — `/plan <slug>` writes `plan.md` (approach, steps, files to change,
   validation, rollback), advances `research-complete → spec-complete`.
5. **Review gate** — a reviewer runs `/review <slug> APPROVED "<rationale>"`.
   On APPROVED, advances `spec-complete → plan-complete → approved`.
6. **Implement** — `/implement <slug>` creates branch `ticket/<slug>` from clean
   `dev_new`, applies **only** the files named in `plan.md`, leaves the work
   uncommitted, writes `implement.md`, advances `approved →
   implementation-in-progress → implemented`.
7. **Verify gate** — a reviewer runs `/verify <slug>`. On PASSED, writes
   `verify.md` and advances `implemented → verified → closed`.
8. **Manual delivery** — the developer delivers the closed ticket by hand (no
   command): stage the publishable set by explicit paths (implementation changes +
   `implement.md` + `verify.md` + the `ticket.md` closure update) with
   `git add <paths>`, confirm with `git diff --cached --name-status`, `git commit`,
   `git push -u origin ticket/<slug>`, then open the PR on GitHub's web UI (base
   branch `dev_new`) and paste the URL into `ticket.md > links.github`. State stays
   unchanged; this is orthogonal to the state machine, not a lifecycle stage.

## 6. Command Usage Guide

All commands operate on `.claude/_specs/<slug>/`. Every command except `/start-ticket`
begins by reading `ticket.md` and ends by writing the transition back to
`ticket.md` (the single state write per ADR-003). All commands are **atomic** — on
precondition failure they write nothing. Manual delivery (after `/verify` closes the
ticket) is not a command; when the developer pastes the PR URL into `links.github`
by hand, no `state` or state-history is changed.

### `/start-ticket`
- **Purpose:** Bootstrap a ticket workspace; set mode; initialize state to
  `draft`. Does **not** create a branch.
- **Inputs:** `slug` (required), `"title"` (required unless seeded from ClickUp),
  `mode=standard|high_risk` (default `standard`; `fast` rejected), optional
  `owner=`, optional `links`, optional `clickup_id=` (see §8).
- **Outputs / artifacts:** `.claude/_specs/<slug>/ticket.md` (state record, initial
  history row) + `.claude/_specs/<slug>/intake.md`.
- **Owner:** Developer / AI Agent.
- **Result state:** `draft`.

### `/research`
- **Purpose:** Read-only investigation of the repo and impact.
- **Inputs:** `slug`.
- **Outputs / artifacts:** `research.md` (relevant directories, config files,
  affected services, available validation commands, risks, open questions);
  updates `ticket.md`.
- **Precondition:** `state = draft` **and** `intake.md` Readiness = `READY`.
- **Owner:** Developer / AI Agent.
- **Result state:** `ready-for-research`.

### `/spec`
- **Purpose:** Define what "done" means — requirements + acceptance criteria with
  stable IDs. **No implementation detail** (no file names, code, or steps).
- **Inputs:** `slug`.
- **Outputs / artifacts:** `spec.md` (business goal, user story, functional /
  non-functional requirements, constraints, edge cases, `AC-n` mapping, out of
  scope); updates `ticket.md`.
- **Precondition:** `state = ready-for-research`; `research.md` complete.
- **Owner:** Developer / AI Agent.
- **Result state:** `research-complete`.

### `/plan`
- **Purpose:** Decide the approach and concrete steps. Does **not** approve and
  does **not** branch.
- **Inputs:** `slug`.
- **Outputs / artifacts:** `plan.md` (approach, steps, **files to change**,
  validation strategy, rollback, out of scope); updates `ticket.md`.
- **Precondition (one of):** *Initial* — `state = research-complete`; *Revision* —
  `state = spec-complete` **and** latest `review.md` Decision =
  `CHANGES_REQUESTED` (then it addresses the Required Follow-up Actions).
- **Owner:** Developer / AI Agent.
- **Result state:** `spec-complete` (initial advances to it; revision stays
  there).

### `/review` — gate
- **Purpose:** Reviewer validates spec + plan and records the decision; only
  `APPROVED` unlocks implementation.
- **Inputs:** `slug`, `decision` (`APPROVED|CHANGES_REQUESTED|REJECTED`),
  `"rationale"`; for `high_risk` + `APPROVED`: the approver name (not the author)
  + ADR reference.
- **Outputs / artifacts:** `review.md` (scope, decision, approvals, ADR
  reference, required follow-ups); updates `ticket.md` on APPROVED/REJECTED.
- **Precondition:** `state = spec-complete`; `plan.md` complete with plan↔REQ/AC
  traceability; invoker is the `reviewer` and not the author (see §7).
- **Owner:** **Reviewer**.
- **Result state:** `APPROVED → approved`; `CHANGES_REQUESTED → spec-complete`
  (unchanged); `REJECTED → closed`.

### `/implement`
- **Purpose:** Apply **only** the changes `plan.md` lists. First command that
  mutates source.
- **Inputs:** `slug`.
- **Outputs / artifacts:** branch `ticket/<slug>` (initial path only, from clean
  `dev_new`); working-tree changes left **uncommitted** on that branch;
  `implement.md` (changes prepared, deviations, validation run). The delivery commit
  is created **manually by the developer** at delivery (no command creates a commit).
- **Precondition (one of):** *Initial* — `state = approved` and `review.md` =
  APPROVED, no existing branch, clean `dev_new`; *Resume* — `state =
  implementation-in-progress` with the branch already checked out.
- **Owner:** Developer / AI Agent.
- **Result state:** `implemented` (complete) **or** `implementation-in-progress`
  + `status: blocked` (blocked).

### `/verify` — gate
- **Purpose:** Validate that every acceptance criterion is met (read-only on
  implementation); owns success-closure.
- **Inputs:** `slug`.
- **Outputs / artifacts:** `verify.md` (AC→test→result table, commands + output,
  high-risk-impact yes/no statement, sign-off); updates `ticket.md`.
- **Precondition:** `state = implemented`; `spec.md` has `AC-n` IDs;
  `implement.md` records changed files and implementation evidence; invoker is
  the `reviewer` and not the author (see §7).
- **Verification depth:** `standard` → every AC; `high_risk` → every AC **plus a
  rollback rehearsal**.
- **Owner:** **Reviewer**.
- **Result state:** `PASSED → closed`; `FAILED → implementation-in-progress` +
  `status: blocked`.

### Manual delivery to GitHub (not a command)
- **Purpose:** Deliver a verified/closed ticket to GitHub as a Pull Request. This
  is a **manual** git step performed by the developer, orthogonal to the lifecycle
  state machine — there is no delivery command.
- **When:** after `/verify` closes the ticket (`state ∈ {verified, closed}`), with
  the local branch `ticket/<slug>` present.
- **Steps (by hand):**
  1. `git add <the implemented files> .claude/_specs/<slug>/` (stage explicit paths
     only — never `git add -A`).
  2. `git diff --cached --name-status` (confirm the staged set — nothing unrelated).
  3. `git commit -m "<type>(<area>): <summary>"` (the single delivery commit on
     `ticket/<slug>`).
  4. `git push -u origin ticket/<slug>`.
  5. Open the Pull Request on GitHub's web UI (base branch `dev_new`), then paste the
     PR URL into `ticket.md > links.github`.
- **Owner:** Developer.
- **Result state:** unchanged. No state-history entry is appended.
- **Boundaries:** GitHub is delivery only. PR status, review state, checks, merge
  state, comments, labels, and branch deletion are out of scope and never drive
  workflow state. No command or CLI performs the push/PR — it is manual git plus
  opening the PR in the browser.

### Expected artifacts and delivery outputs

| Stage/action | Artifact or delivery output | Owner role |
|---|---|---|
| intake | `ticket.md`, `intake.md` | developer / ai_agent |
| research | `research.md` | developer / ai_agent |
| spec | `spec.md` | developer / ai_agent |
| plan | `plan.md` | developer / ai_agent |
| review | `review.md` | reviewer |
| implement | `implement.md` (+ uncommitted branch work) | developer / ai_agent |
| verify | `verify.md` | reviewer |
| delivery (manual) | Git commit + push + GitHub PR (opened by hand) + `links.github` | developer |

### Validation profiles (config-driven, optional)

A ticket *may* name one **validation profile** in `plan.md`'s Validation
strategy. Profiles let `/verify` run real checks without hardcoding any
framework-specific command (ADR-006, rules VP-1..VP-5):

- **Two separate config concepts** in `project-config.yaml`: `validation_checks`
  (definitions — a check-id → command + pass condition; **commands live only
  here**) and `validation_profiles` (selection — a profile lists required
  check-ids + a depth tag, and references **check-ids only**).
- **`/verify` resolves** profile → checks → commands, executes each required check
  (depth ≤ the mode tier) **locally**, and records the command, exit code, output
  summary, and result mapped to `AC-n`.
- Commands must be **deterministic, non-interactive, and read-only** w.r.t.
  implementation files (VP-2/VP-3, preserving `VF-7`).
- **Opt-in:** no profile named ⇒ `/plan` and `/verify` behave exactly as before
  (VP-5). Execution is **local only** — no GitHub, CI/CD, MCP, or external runner.

Profiles defined for Trydos (`project-config.yaml > validation_profiles`):

| Profile | Use when | Runs |
|---|---|---|
| `flutter-standard` | default for normal Flutter changes | `flutter analyze` |
| `codegen-change` | models / `@injectable` / DI changed | `sh gen.sh` equivalent + no-diff, then analyze |
| `localization-change` | `assets/languages/*.json` or locale keys changed | four-bundle parity + `sh keys.sh` no-diff + analyze |
| `hydrated-state-change` | a persisted `hydrated_bloc` state shape changed | codegen no-diff + analyze + rollback rehearsal |

### Next-step guidance

Every command emits a short **Next step** block after successful completion or a
safe blocked/failed outcome:

- **Current state** — `ticket.md > state` after the command.
- **Next command** — the next legal workflow command, or `none` when no workflow
  command remains.
- **Required actions** — manual work needed before the next command can run.
- **Optional actions** — useful but non-required actions, such as the manual GitHub
  delivery step (commit + push + open PR by hand) after `/verify` closes a ticket.
- **Terminal?** — whether the workflow itself is complete.

This guidance is derived from `ticket.md` and the canonical state machine; it is
operator help only and never changes state.

## 7. Approval Gates

There are exactly **two** gates, both reviewer-owned, both mandatory in every
mode.

### Gate 1 — `/review` (before any implementation)
- **Who approves:** the reviewer (not the author).
- **What it decides:** whether the spec + plan may proceed to implementation.
- **Approvals required:** `standard` = **1** reviewer; `high_risk` = **1**
  reviewer who is **not** the plan author **and** an ADR reference
  (`project-config.yaml > modes`).
- **What blocks progress:** any state other than `spec-complete`; an incomplete
  `plan.md`; missing plan↔REQ/AC traceability; `high_risk` approved by the author
  or without an ADR. A `CHANGES_REQUESTED` keeps the ticket at `spec-complete`; a
  `REJECTED` closes it (terminal).
- **What does *not* block:** nothing about artifact existence alone advances or
  blocks — only `ticket.md > state` and the recorded decision matter.

### Gate 2 — `/verify` (closure)
- **Who approves:** the reviewer (not the author).
- **What it decides:** PASSED (close the ticket) or FAILED (return to rework).
- **Pass condition:** every `AC-n` maps to a passing result at the mode's depth
  (`standard` all-AC; `high_risk` all-AC + rollback rehearsal).
- **What blocks progress:** any state other than `implemented`; a missing AC
  mapping; missing implementation evidence in `implement.md`; any failing AC.
- **What does *not* block:** the high-risk-impact statement must be *present*
  (yes/no), but a "no impact" answer does not block.

### Separation of duties (current configuration)
`separation_of_duties.enabled: true`. `allow_self_review.standard: false` and
`high_risk: false`. **Therefore, today, every ticket requires the reviewer at
both gates to be someone other than the author** — self-review is not currently
permitted for any mode. (`standard` self-review is a configurable opt-in that is
switched off.)

### What is *not* a gate
- `/start-ticket`, `/research`, `/spec`, `/plan`, `/implement` are **not**
  approval gates. They are author actions. `/plan` produces the plan but does not
  approve it; approval is exclusively `/review`.
- Manual GitHub delivery is **not** an approval gate and not a lifecycle
  transition. It is delivery-only (by hand) after successful verification.
- There is **no `/close` command.** Closure happens only at `/verify` (PASSED) or
  `/review` (REJECTED).

## 8. ClickUp Intake Process

ClickUp integration is **read-only** (ADR-005, CU-1..CU-5). It is an optional
intake convenience on `/start-ticket` only.

### How it works
- Invoke `/start-ticket` with `clickup_id=<task-id>`.
- The command calls the isolated helper `.claude/scripts/clickup_intake.py`, which
  performs **one** read-only `GET /api/v2/task/{id}` and returns
  `{title, description, url}`. All ClickUp HTTP logic lives only in that helper;
  the command embeds none.
- Authentication: the helper reads `CLICKUP_API_TOKEN` from the **environment**
  (a ClickUp personal API token, read scope). It is never stored in a committed
  file.
- Atomicity: if the token is unset (CU-1) or the fetch fails (CU-2 — e.g. 401,
  404, network), `/start-ticket` aborts and **creates nothing**.

### Exactly what is imported
- **Task title** → ticket title (`ticket.md > title`).
- **Task description** → intake summary (`intake.md` Ticket Summary).
- **Task URL** → `links.clickup` (in `ticket.md` / `intake.md`).
- **Slug:** a user-supplied slug is primary; if none is given, the slug defaults
  to `cu-<clickup_id>`.

### Exactly what is NOT imported / NOT done
- **No status sync** — ClickUp task status is never read into workflow state.
- **No comment sync.**
- **No write-back** — no POST/PUT/DELETE/PATCH; nothing is ever sent to ClickUp.
- **No task creation or closure** in ClickUp.
- **No workflow-state mapping** — `ticket.md` remains the sole canonical state
  owner; no state is derived from ClickUp.
- **No MCP** — direct REST only, by design.

## 9. Common Operational Scenarios

### A. Create a ticket from scratch
1. `/start-ticket my-slug "Short title" mode=standard`
2. Edit `.claude/_specs/my-slug/intake.md`; set Readiness Status to `READY`.
3. `/research my-slug` → `/spec my-slug` → `/plan my-slug`.
4. Reviewer: `/review my-slug APPROVED "rationale"`.
5. `/implement my-slug` → `/verify my-slug`.
6. Optional manual delivery after closure: `git add` the ticket's files → `git diff
   --cached --name-status` → `git commit` → `git push -u origin ticket/my-slug` →
   open the PR on GitHub (base `dev_new`) → paste the URL into `ticket.md > links.github`.

### B. Create a ticket from ClickUp
1. Locally: `export CLICKUP_API_TOKEN=<read-scope token>` (never commit/paste it).
2. `/start-ticket clickup_id=<task-id>` (slug defaults to `cu-<task-id>`; or pass
   an explicit slug to override).
3. Confirm `ticket.md` title and `links.clickup` were seeded; `state` is `draft`.
4. Continue as in Scenario A from step 2.

### C. Reviewer requests changes
1. Reviewer: `/review my-slug CHANGES_REQUESTED "what to fix"`. Ticket stays at
   `spec-complete`; follow-ups recorded in `review.md`.
2. Author: `/plan my-slug` (revision mode) — rewrites `plan.md` addressing the
   Required Follow-up Actions; stays `spec-complete`, resets any `blocked` flag.
3. Reviewer: `/review my-slug APPROVED "rationale"` → `approved`.

### D. Verification fails
1. Reviewer: `/verify my-slug` finds a failing AC → writes `verify.md` with the
   failure, sets `state = implementation-in-progress`, `status: blocked`.
2. Author: `/implement my-slug` (resume) — fixes on the existing branch (no new
   branch), advances back to `implemented`.
3. Reviewer: `/verify my-slug` again.

### E. Ticket returns to implementation (rework)
This is the union of D and the `/implement` blocked path. Any return to
`implementation-in-progress` is resumed by `/implement` on the **existing**
`ticket/<slug>` branch — `/implement` never creates a second branch on resume.

### F. Ticket closure
- **Success:** `/verify` PASSED → `implemented → verified → closed`.
- **Rejection:** `/review` REJECTED → `spec-complete → closed`.
- In both cases `closed` is terminal — to revisit the work, open a new ticket.

### G. Deliver to GitHub (manual)
1. Confirm the ticket is `closed` after a PASSED `/verify`.
2. Stage the ticket's files by explicit paths: `git add <the implemented files>
   .claude/_specs/my-slug/`, then `git diff --cached --name-status` to confirm the
   staged set.
3. `git commit -m "<type>(<area>): <summary>"` then `git push -u origin
   ticket/my-slug`.
4. Open the Pull Request on GitHub's web UI (base branch `dev_new`), then paste the PR
   URL into `ticket.md > links.github`.
5. Confirm `ticket.md > links.github` contains the PR URL and `state` is
   unchanged. GitHub review/merge then happens out of band and is not read back
   into the workflow.

## 10. Troubleshooting Guide

Commands report a stable rule code (e.g. `ST-2`, `CMD-1`) on failure
(`validation-model.md`). Common situations:

| Symptom / rule code | Likely cause | Expected action |
|---|---|---|
| `/research` aborts (`RS-7`/`CMD-1`) | `intake.md` not marked `READY`, or state ≠ `draft` | Fill intake, set Readiness `READY`, retry |
| `/spec` aborts (`SP-7`) | `research.md` missing/incomplete | Run/complete `/research` first |
| `/plan` aborts (`PL-7`) | Not at `research-complete`, or revision attempted without a `CHANGES_REQUESTED` review | Confirm entry mode; only revise after CHANGES_REQUESTED |
| `/review` aborts (`RA-1`/`RA-3`) | Invoker is the author, or not the reviewer role (self-review is off) | A different qualified reviewer runs the gate |
| `/review` high_risk aborts (`RV-5`/`RV-6`) | Approver is the plan author, or ADR reference missing | Supply a non-author approver + ADR, retry |
| `/implement` blocks (`IM-8`) | Dirty `dev_new`, branch collision, ambiguous plan, or a high-risk path (`project-config.yaml > high_risk_paths`) without `high_risk` | Clean `dev_new` / resolve branch / tighten `plan.md` / re-scope as `high_risk` |
| `/implement` sets `status: blocked` (`IM-10`) | Needed file not in plan (scope creep) or unsafe/unclear condition | Resume after `/plan` revision, or fix the blocker and resume |
| `/verify` aborts (`VF-8`/`CMD-1`) | State ≠ `implemented`, or missing AC IDs / implementation evidence | Complete `/implement`; ensure `spec.md` has `AC-n` and `implement.md` records changed files/evidence |
| `/verify` FAILED | An AC did not pass | Fix via `/implement` resume, re-verify |
| ClickUp intake aborts (`CU-1`/`CU-2`) | `CLICKUP_API_TOKEN` unset, or fetch failed (401/404/network) | Set a valid read-scope token; verify the task id; retry (nothing was written) |
| Manual delivery can't push/open a PR | Ticket not verified/closed, or branch `ticket/<slug>` missing/not checked out | Finish `/verify`; check out or restore `ticket/<slug>`; then run the manual git steps (`git add` explicit paths → `diff --cached` → `commit` → `push`) and open the PR by hand |
| Any command made a partial write | Should not happen — all commands are atomic | Treat as a bug; the ticket state in `ticket.md` is authoritative — reconcile from it |

**General rule:** when in doubt about "where is this ticket?", read
`.claude/_specs/<slug>/ticket.md > state`. That field — not the presence of any artifact
— is the truth.

## 11. Governance Escalation Guide

Escalate to the **Workflow Owner** (not the per-ticket reviewer) when a situation
is a *governance* question rather than a ticket decision. From `CLAUDE.md` "Hard
stop conditions" and the role model:

Escalate when:
- A change would touch a **high-risk path** (`project-config.yaml > high_risk_paths`)
  — or alter authentication/session, persisted hydrated-BLoC state shape, or
  wallet/order money integrity — outside an approved `high_risk` implement stage.
- A request requires **deleting or rewriting existing workflow artifacts**, or
  the canonical config (`project-config.yaml`, `.claude/_specs/`,
  `.claude/commands/README.md`).
- **Acceptance criteria are missing, ambiguous, or untestable** and cannot be
  resolved within the spec stage.
- **Scope grows beyond** the approved spec/plan.
- A **stage's entry criteria cannot be met** legitimately (e.g. pressure to
  implement before approval, or to skip a gate).
- A **mode dispute** arises (e.g. whether work is `standard` vs `high_risk`).
- A **workflow rule itself** needs changing, or a cross-project/governance
  decision is required.

Do **not** escalate routine ticket decisions (plan approval, change requests,
verification outcomes) — those are the reviewer's authority. The Workflow Owner
owns the *workflow*, not individual tickets.

## 12. Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Where does a ticket's state actually live?**
In `.claude/_specs/<slug>/ticket.md > state`. Nowhere else. Don't infer state from which
files exist (ADR-003).

**Q: Can the person who wrote the plan also approve it?**
No. Self-review is currently disabled for all modes
(`allow_self_review.standard: false`). A different qualified reviewer must run
`/review` and `/verify`.

**Q: Can the AI agent approve my ticket?**
No. The AI is advisory only and never an approval authority. A human reviewer
makes gate decisions.

**Q: When is the git branch created?**
Only by `/implement`, on the initial path, after the ticket is `approved`, from a
clean `dev_new`, named `ticket/<slug>`. `/start-ticket` never creates a branch, and
no branch exists for an unapproved ticket. `/implement` does not commit or push;
the developer creates the single delivery commit and pushes the branch **manually**
after successful verification.

**Q: Does GitHub PR state ever update `ticket.md > state`?**
No. GitHub is delivery only. The developer pastes the PR URL into
`ticket.md > links.github` by hand; no PR status, review, check, merge, or comment
data is read back into workflow state.

**Q: How do I fix a plan the reviewer rejected with CHANGES_REQUESTED?**
Re-run `/plan` in revision mode; it rewrites `plan.md` to address the follow-ups
and keeps the ticket at `spec-complete`. Then re-run `/review`.

**Q: What's the difference between `REJECTED` and `CHANGES_REQUESTED`?**
`CHANGES_REQUESTED` keeps the ticket alive at `spec-complete` for revision.
`REJECTED` closes the ticket (terminal) — you would open a new ticket to revisit.

**Q: My verification couldn't run a check because of missing credentials. Is that
a FAIL?**
`/verify` is binary today: PASSED (→closed) or FAILED (→rework). There is no
"pending/incomplete" outcome in V1. If an AC genuinely cannot be evidenced, it
cannot be recorded as passing, so the ticket cannot be closed; the reviewer
decides whether to record FAILED (rework) or hold the ticket at `implemented`
until evidence is available. (This binary limitation is a known characteristic of
V1; resolving it is a governance matter, not a per-ticket action.)

**Q: Can I use `fast` mode?**
No. `fast` is deferred and not selectable in V1 — `/start-ticket` rejects
`mode: fast`. Use `standard` or `high_risk`.

**Q: What does `high_risk` require that `standard` doesn't?**
An approver who can never be the author (self-review is impossible in any case
today), a mandatory ADR referenced at `/review`, and a rollback rehearsal during
`/verify`. Use it for high-risk paths (`project-config.yaml > high_risk_paths`),
auth/session, `ServerName`/api-network, `main.dart` init order, persisted
hydrated-BLoC state shape, calls/push, wallet or order money changes,
irreversible, or wide-blast-radius work (including registering a new **app-wide**
BLoC in DI + `ServiceProvider`; a feature-local BLoC is normal `standard` work).

**Q: Does ClickUp ever get updated by the workflow?**
No. ClickUp is read-only intake (title, description, URL). No status sync, no
comments, no write-back, no task creation/closure, no MCP.

**Q: What can I safely re-run?**
`/research` is idempotent while at `ready-for-research`/`research-complete`.
`/plan` supports a revision re-run after `CHANGES_REQUESTED`. `/implement`
supports resume from `implementation-in-progress`. Re-running a command in the
wrong state aborts atomically (nothing is written).

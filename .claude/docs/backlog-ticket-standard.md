# TryDos Backlog Ticket Standard

> **Purpose:** This is the official reference for writing tickets (User Stories / Work
> Items) in TryDos. Every team member must follow it. Any ticket that does not follow this
> standard is sent back to its author to be rewritten.

## Required metadata (ClickUp Custom Fields)

Every one of these fields must be filled at the top of the ticket:

| Property | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Title** | Text | ✔️ | Short title in the form: Verb + Object (e.g. "Create User") |
| **ID** | Auto | ✔️ | Generated automatically |
| **Status** | Status | ✔️ | Official workflow (below) |
| **Backbone** | Select | ✔️ | The module (Cart, Checklist, Notifications, Mobile Home, Web Home, Auth, RDP…) |
| **Actor** | Multi-select | ✔️ | System Admin, Account Admin, Normal User, System |
| **Assignee** | Person | ✔️ | The responsible person |
| **Time Estimate (h)** | Number | ✔️ | Estimate in hours |
| **Sprint** | Relation | ⬜ | Linked sprint |
| **User Story Relation** | Relation | ⬜ | Link to the Epic |
| **Estimation per User Story** | Relation | ⬜ | Extra estimates (optional) |

### Status workflow

`Backlog` → `Planned` → `TODO` → `In progress` → `Ready For Developer Review` →
`Ready For EM Review` → `EM Testing (DEV ENV)` → `Ready For Release` →
`In Release (STAGING)` → `Released To PROD`

# Common Mistakes to Avoid When Writing Tickets

## 1. Bad Titles
- ❌ Using vague nouns like "Tickets", "Users", "Orders"
- ✔ Use action-oriented titles: "Create User", "Edit Order", "Delete Ticket"

## 2. Incorrect User Story Format
- ❌ Missing "so that…"
- ❌ Repeating the action instead of stating the benefit
- ✔ Must follow: As a…, I want…, so that…

## 3. Acceptance Criteria Problems
- ❌ Writing AC as one long paragraph
- ❌ No numbered lists
- ❌ No sub-sections
- ❌ Missing validation rules
- ❌ Missing authorization rules
- ✔ AC must be atomic, testable, grouped into sections

## 4. Missing Error/Validation Behavior
- ❌ Only describing the happy path
- ✔ Must include validation errors and authorization failures

## 5. Missing Test Cases
- ❌ No test cases at all
- ❌ Test cases not in Given/When/Then format
- ✔ Must include: Happy Path, Validation Error, Authorization Failure

## 6. Missing Required Metadata
- ❌ No Assignee
- ❌ No Time Estimate
- ❌ No Actor
- ❌ No Backbone
- ✔ All metadata must be filled before the ticket is accepted

## 7. Ambiguous Wording
- ❌ Using "maybe", "etc.", "should probably"
- ✔ Replace with explicit, testable statements

## 8. No Reference to Related Tickets
- ❌ Not linking to parent Epic or related stories
- ✔ Always reference related tickets by ID

## The workflow path (standard mode)

```
/start-ticket  → draft
   (fill intake.md, set Readiness: READY)
/research      → ready-for-research
/spec          → research-complete      (writes AC-1, AC-2, …)
/plan          → spec-complete
/review APPROVED → approved              ← reviewer, not you
/implement     → implemented             (creates branch ticket/<slug>)
/verify        → closed                  ← reviewer, not you
(manual)       → state unchanged         (deliver by hand: commit + push + open PR)
```

- Author commands (you/AI): `start-ticket, research, spec, plan, implement`
- Gate commands (a different reviewer): `review, verify`
- **Delivery to GitHub is manual** — after closure you commit, push, and open the PR
  by hand (no command). It is not a gate and does not change workflow state.

## Command quick reference

| Command | Does | Precondition state | Result state |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/start-ticket <slug> "<title>"` | Create workspace + `intake.md` | — | `draft` |
| `/research <slug>` | Read-only repo investigation | `draft` + intake `READY` | `ready-for-research` |
| `/spec <slug>` | Requirements + acceptance criteria (`AC-n`) | `ready-for-research` | `research-complete` |
| `/plan <slug>` | Approach, steps, files, validation, rollback | `research-complete` (or revision) | `spec-complete` |
| `/review <slug> <decision> "<why>"` | Reviewer approves/blocks the plan | `spec-complete` | `approved` / stays / `closed` |
| `/implement <slug>` | Apply only planned files; branch, no commit/push | `approved` (or resume) | `implemented` / blocked |
| `/verify <slug>` | Reviewer checks every AC; closes ticket | `implemented` | `closed` / FAILED→rework |
| *(manual delivery — no command)* | By hand: `git add` explicit paths, commit, push, open PR, paste `links.github` | `verified`/`closed` | unchanged |

## Daily rules of thumb

- **State lives in one place:** `.claude/_specs/<slug>/ticket.md > state`. To find "where
  is my ticket?", read that field — never guess from which files exist.
- **Every command is atomic:** if a precondition fails, *nothing* is written.
  Fix the cause and re-run.
- **You can't approve your own work.** Self-review is off — a different qualified
  reviewer runs `/review` and `/verify`.
- **AI is advisory.** It can draft and run author commands; it never approves.
- **Touch source only in `/implement`,** and only files listed in `plan.md`.
- **`spec.md` has no implementation detail** — no file names, no code. That's
  `plan.md`'s job.
- **Branch is born at `/implement`,** named `ticket/<slug>`, from clean `dev_new`,
  only after `approved`. `/implement` leaves changes uncommitted; you create the
  single delivery commit and push it **manually** at delivery.
- **GitHub is delivery only.** You paste the PR URL into `ticket.md > links.github`
  by hand; PR status/reviews/checks/merge state never drive workflow state.
- **`closed` is terminal.** No reopen — open a new ticket.
- **`blocked` is a flag, not a state** (`status: blocked`), and halts advancement.

## Modes (pick at `/start-ticket`)

| | standard | high_risk |
|---|---|---|
| Use for | normal, bounded work | high-risk paths (auth/session & tokens, `lib/core/api/**` + `ServerName`, composition root & `main.dart` init order, persisted hydrated-BLoC state shape, calls/push, wallet/order money, config/secrets, generated code), registering a new **app-wide** BLoC, irreversible, wide blast radius |
| Approvals | 1 reviewer | 1 reviewer, never the author |
| ADR | optional | **mandatory** |
| Verify depth | every AC | every AC + **rollback rehearsal** |

- `fast` mode is **deferred — not selectable.** `/start-ticket` rejects it.

## Review outcomes — what to do next

- **APPROVED** → `approved`; run `/implement`.
- **CHANGES_REQUESTED** → stays `spec-complete`; re-run `/plan` (revision,
  addressing the follow-ups) → `/review` again.
- **REJECTED** → `closed` (terminal); open a new ticket to revisit.

## When things stall

- **Verify FAILED** → `implementation-in-progress` + `blocked`. Run `/implement`
  (resume — same branch, no new branch), then `/verify` again.
- **Implement blocked** (needed file not in plan / unsafe) → ticket stays
  `implementation-in-progress` + `blocked`. Either revise via `/plan` then
  resume, or clear the blocker and resume `/implement`.
- **Re-runs that are safe:** `/research` (idempotent while at research stages),
  `/plan` (revision after CHANGES_REQUESTED), `/implement` (resume).

## Next steps

Every command prints a **Next step** block: current state, next command, required
actions, optional actions, and whether the workflow is terminal. Treat it as
operator guidance derived from `ticket.md`; it is not state. After `/verify`
PASSES and closes the ticket, the next workflow command is `none`; optional
delivery is the **manual** GitHub step (commit + push + open PR by hand).

## ClickUp intake (optional, read-only)

```bash
export CLICKUP_API_TOKEN=<read-scope token>   # local shell only; never commit
/start-ticket clickup_id=<task-id>            # slug defaults to cu-<task-id>
```

- **Imports:** title → ticket title, description → intake summary, URL →
  `links.clickup`.
- **Never:** status sync, comments, write-back, task create/close, MCP, or any
  workflow-state from ClickUp. `ticket.md` stays canonical.
- Fetch/token failure → aborts, **creates nothing**.

## Validation profiles (optional, config-driven)

- Name **one** profile in `plan.md` Validation strategy: `Validation profile: <id>`.
- Two separate config blocks in `project-config.yaml`: `validation_checks`
  (check-id → command + pass condition; **commands only here**) and
  `validation_profiles` (lists required check-ids + depth; **no commands**).
- `/verify` resolves profile → checks → commands, runs them **locally**, records
  command + exit code + output summary + result → `AC-n`.
- Commands must be **deterministic, non-interactive, read-only**. No profile ⇒
  behaves exactly as before. No GitHub/CI/MCP/external runner.

| Profile | Use when |
|---|---|
| `flutter-standard` | default — `flutter analyze` |
| `codegen-change` | models / `@injectable` / DI changed (`sh gen.sh` stays in sync) |
| `localization-change` | `assets/languages/*.json` or locale keys changed (four bundles in sync + `sh keys.sh`) |
| `hydrated-state-change` | a persisted `hydrated_bloc` state shape changed (+ rollback rehearsal) |

## GitHub delivery (manual — no command)

```bash
git add lib/... .claude/_specs/<slug>/     # explicit paths only, never git add -A
git diff --cached --name-status            # CONFIRM the staged set
git commit -m "feat(<area>): <summary>"
git push -u origin ticket/<slug>
# then open the compare URL in the browser, set base = dev_new, create the PR,
# and paste the PR URL into ticket.md > links.github
```

- Done by hand after successful `/verify` (`state: verified` or `closed`). No
  command and no CLI performs the push/PR — it is plain `git` plus opening the PR
  in the browser.
- Stage **explicit paths** and confirm with `git diff --cached` so nothing unrelated
  rides in; create the single delivery commit; push `ticket/<slug>` (base `dev_new`).
- The only thing recorded back is the PR URL in `ticket.md > links.github`, pasted
  in manually; `ticket.md > state` and state-history stay unchanged.
- GitHub remains out of band: no status sync, review sync, checks sync,
  auto-merge, branch deletion, or GitHub-derived workflow state.

## Common failures → fast fixes

| Hitting | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `/research` won't run | intake not `READY` / not `draft` | set Readiness `READY`, retry |
| `/spec` won't run | `research.md` incomplete | finish `/research` |
| `/plan` won't run | not at `research-complete` (or no CHANGES_REQUESTED for revision) | check state/entry mode |
| `/review` won't run | you're the author / not reviewer | a different reviewer runs it |
| `/implement` blocks | dirty `dev_new`, branch exists, vague plan, high-risk path w/o high_risk | clean dev_new / tighten plan / use high_risk |
| `/verify` won't run | state ≠ `implemented`, missing AC IDs or implementation evidence | complete `/implement` first |
| Can't deliver (push/PR) | not verified/closed, or branch `ticket/<slug>` missing | finish `/verify`, check out/restore the branch, then run the manual git steps + open the PR by hand |
| ClickUp intake fails | token unset / fetch 401·404 | set valid token, check task id, retry |

## Escalate to the Workflow Owner when…

- A change would hit a high-risk path (`project-config.yaml > high_risk_paths`) — or alter authentication/session, persisted hydrated-BLoC state shape, or wallet/order money integrity — outside an approved `high_risk` implement.
- You'd need to delete/rewrite workflow artifacts or canonical config.
- Acceptance criteria are missing/ambiguous/untestable.
- Scope grows beyond the approved spec/plan, or a gate would be skipped.
- Mode (`standard` vs `high_risk`) is disputed.

*(Routine plan/verify decisions are the reviewer's call — not an escalation.)*

# Command Architecture — Engineering Workflow v1 (Phase 5, design only)

> **Status: architecture/design.** No command files, slash-command markdown, or
> automation are created by this phase. This document is the contract a
> developer implements against in a later phase — it should require **no further
> architectural decisions** to implement.

> **v1 scope:** modes are **`standard` and `high_risk` only**. `fast` mode is
> deferred to a future version — `/start-ticket` rejects `mode: fast`, and no
> command implements the fast path. References to FAST below describe the
> deferred design, not v1 behavior.

All commands operate on a single ticket workspace `.claude/_specs/<ticket>/` and the
front-matter defined in `.claude/rules/workflow-rules.md`. Non-mutating commands
(`/research`, `/spec`, `/plan`, `/review`) must not edit source or
any high-risk path (`project-config.yaml > high_risk_paths`). Every command updates the ticket's canonical state (§2) and
the touched artifact's `status` front-matter.

**State ownership (ADR-003):** the ticket's workflow state is owned solely by
`.claude/_specs/<ticket>/ticket.md > state`. `/start-ticket` creates that record with
`state: draft`; every other command **reads** `ticket.md`, validates the
transition, performs its work, then **writes** the new `state` back to
`ticket.md`. Commands must never infer state from artifact existence.

---

## 1. Command contracts

Conventions: "ticket state" = `ticket.md > state` (the canonical state machine,
§2). "artifact status" = `not_started | in_progress | blocked | complete`, local
to each artifact. `<ticket>` = slug.

### /start-ticket
- **Purpose:** Create the ticket workspace, author `intake.md`, set mode,
  initialize state. **Does not create a branch** (see §3).
- **Inputs:** `id/slug`, `title`, `goal`, `mode` (STANDARD|HIGH_RISK; FAST
  rejected in v1), optional `links` (ClickUp/GitHub), optional `clickup_id`
  (read-only ClickUp intake — see below).
- **Outputs:** `.claude/_specs/<ticket>/` dir; `ticket.md` (the state record, `state:
  draft`, with an initial state-history row); `intake.md` (front-matter filled).
- **ClickUp intake (optional, read-only — CU-1..CU-5):** if `clickup_id` is given,
  `/start-ticket` invokes the isolated helper `.claude/scripts/clickup_intake.py` (the
  **only** home of ClickUp HTTP logic — the command embeds none) to fetch
  `title`/`description`/`url` via a single read-only GET, then maps them into
  `ticket.md`/`intake.md` (`url` → `links.clickup`). **Slug:** user-provided slug
  is primary; default `cu-<clickup_id>` only when no slug is supplied. **Token:**
  the helper reads `CLICKUP_API_TOKEN` from the environment — obtain a ClickUp
  personal API token (read scope) and export it; it is never stored in a
  committed file. Read-only: never writes to ClickUp; `ticket.md` stays the
  canonical state owner. On fetch failure → abort atomically (CU-4).
- **Preconditions:** slug unused (no workspace dir); valid mode; if `clickup_id`,
  CU-1 (token set) and CU-2 (fetch succeeds).
- **Postconditions:** workspace + `ticket.md` + `intake.md` exist; state =
  `draft` (→ `ready-for-research` once intake `READY`). No branch is created.
- **Stop conditions:** slug collision; dirty base; invalid mode; request targets
  a high-risk path (`project-config.yaml > high_risk_paths`) without `HIGH_RISK` + review-gate context.
- **State transitions:** ∅ → `draft` only. The `draft → ready-for-research`
  transition is owned by `/research` (after intake is marked `READY`), not here.

### /research
- **Purpose:** Investigate the repo (read-only), author `research.md`, and
  advance the ticket `draft → ready-for-research`.
- **Inputs:** `<ticket>`.
- **Outputs:** (1) `research.md` (dirs, configs, affected services, validation
  commands, risks, open questions); (2) `ticket.md` updated — `state:
  ready-for-research`, bumped `updated_at`, **appended state-history entry**.
- **Preconditions:** `ticket.md` exists; state = `draft`; `intake.md` Readiness
  Status = `READY`; mode ∈ {STANDARD, HIGH_RISK}.
- **Postconditions:** `research.md` complete (RS-1..RS-5); `ticket.md > state` =
  `ready-for-research` with a new history row.
- **Stop conditions / failure:** `ticket.md` missing; state ≠ `draft`; intake
  not `READY`. **On any validation failure,
  write nothing** — neither `research.md` nor `ticket.md` is touched (atomic).
  Repository investigation is still read-only (no source/high-risk-path mutation).
- **State transitions:** `draft` → `ready-for-research` (owned by `/research`).
  The subsequent `ready-for-research → research-complete` is owned by `/spec`.
  (Re-run while already `ready-for-research`: refresh `research.md` only, no
  re-transition, no duplicate history.)

### /spec
- **Purpose:** Validate research, advance the ticket to `research-complete`, then
  define requirements + acceptance criteria (stable AC IDs) in `spec.md`. No
  implementation planning.
- **Inputs:** `<ticket>`.
- **Outputs:** (1) `ticket.md` updated — `state: research-complete`, bumped
  `updated_at`, **appended state-history entry**; (2) `spec.md` with
  requirements, AC IDs, and AC→requirement mapping.
- **Preconditions:** `ticket.md` exists; state = `ready-for-research`;
  `research.md` present and complete (RS-1..RS-5); mode ∈ {STANDARD, HIGH_RISK}.
- **Postconditions:** `ticket.md > state` = `research-complete` with a new
  history row; `spec.md` complete (SP-1..SP-5, TR-1).
- **Stop conditions / failure:** `research.md` missing or incomplete; state ≠
  `ready-for-research`; any file
  name/code in spec (SP-4). **On any validation failure, write nothing** —
  neither `ticket.md` nor `spec.md` is touched (atomic).
- **State transitions:** `ready-for-research` → `research-complete` (owned by
  `/spec`). The subsequent `research-complete → spec-complete` is owned by a
  later stage.

### /plan
- **Purpose:** Validate the spec, advance the ticket to `spec-complete`, then
  decide approach, steps, files to change, validation, rollback in `plan.md`.
  Does **not** approve implementation and does **not** create branches.
- **Inputs:** `<ticket>`.
- **Outputs:** (1) `ticket.md` updated — `state: spec-complete`, bumped
  `updated_at`, **appended state-history entry**; (2) `plan.md`. The plan's
  Validation strategy **may** name one validation profile
  (`project-config.yaml > validation_profiles`) by id; commands are never written
  into `plan.md` (they live in `validation_checks`). See VP-1..VP-5 / ADR-006.
- **Preconditions (STANDARD/HIGH_RISK):** `ticket.md` exists; `spec.md` complete
  (SP-1..SP-5, TR-1); and **one** entry mode:
  - *Initial:* state = `research-complete`; or
  - *Revision:* state = `spec-complete` and `review.md` Decision =
    `CHANGES_REQUESTED`.
- **Postconditions:** `ticket.md > state` = `spec-complete` with a new history
  row; `plan.md` complete (PL-1..PL-5). No approval, no branch.
- **Stop conditions / failure:** neither entry mode matched; `spec.md` missing or
  incomplete. **On any validation failure, write nothing** — neither `ticket.md`
  nor `plan.md` (atomic).
- **State transitions:** *Initial:* `research-complete` → `spec-complete`
  (history `spec-validated`). *Revision:* stays `spec-complete` (history
  `plan-revised`; resets `status: blocked → active`). The
  `spec-complete → plan-complete → approved` transitions are owned by `/review`.
- **FAST mode — deferred (not in v1):** the fast edge `ready-for-research →
  plan-complete` (no `spec.md`) is not part of v1; `fast` tickets cannot be
  created (`/start-ticket` rejects `mode: fast`).

### /review  (review gate)
- **Purpose:** A reviewer validates the plan, records the decision in `review.md`, and —
  only when APPROVED — advances `spec-complete → plan-complete → approved`. Does
  not create branches and does not implement anything.
- **Inputs:** `<ticket>`, decision (`APPROVED | CHANGES_REQUESTED | REJECTED`),
  rationale; for `high_risk`: the approver name (never the plan author) + ADR
  reference.
- **Outputs:** `review.md` with decision + follow-ups; on APPROVED, `ticket.md`
  updated (`state: approved`, bumped `updated_at`, history appended).
- **Preconditions:** `ticket.md` exists; state = `spec-complete`; `plan.md`
  present and complete (PL-1..PL-5) with plan↔REQ/AC traceability. Re-review
  after a `/plan` revision is supported (state is still `spec-complete`);
  `review.md` is overwritten with the new decision.
- **Postconditions:**
  - APPROVED → `ticket.md > state` = `approved` (history: `plan-validated` then
    `plan-approved`); for `high_risk`, `review.md` records the non-author
    approver + ADR.
  - CHANGES_REQUESTED → `review.md` written; state stays `spec-complete` (no
    approval); `status: blocked` optional.
  - REJECTED → `review.md` written with reasons; `ticket.md` advances
    `spec-complete → closed` (terminal, history `plan-rejected`). No `/close`
    command needed.
- **Stop conditions / failure:** state ≠ `spec-complete`; `plan.md` missing or
  incomplete; `high_risk` approved by the author or missing its ADR reference. **On any
  required-validation failure, write nothing** (atomic). Never creates a branch.
- **State transitions (owned by `/review`):** APPROVED: `spec-complete` →
  `plan-complete` → `approved`. REJECTED: `spec-complete` → `closed` (terminal).
  CHANGES_REQUESTED: no transition (stays `spec-complete`).

### /implement
- **Purpose:** Apply **only** the changes declared in `plan.md`; record
  `implement.md`; advance the ticket to `implemented`. First command that mutates
  source. Two entry paths: **initial** (from `approved`) and **resume** (from
  `implementation-in-progress`).
- **Inputs:** `<ticket>`.
- **Outputs:** branch `ticket/<slug>` (created on the *initial* path only, from
  clean `dev_new`); code/doc changes confined to `plan.md`'s "Files to change",
  applied to the working tree on that branch (**no commit, no push** — the commit
  is created **manually by the developer** at delivery);
  `implement.md` (files changed, deviations, validation).
- **Preconditions (entry path):**
  - *Initial:* state = `approved` AND `review.md` Decision = APPROVED; no existing
    `ticket/<slug>` branch; `dev_new` clean.
  - *Resume:* state = `implementation-in-progress`; the `ticket/<slug>` branch
    already exists and is checked out.
  - Both: `plan.md` complete (PL-1..PL-5) with an explicit, unambiguous
    "Files to change" list.
- **Postconditions (complete):** changes applied to the working tree on the
  branch (**uncommitted**); `implement.md` records results; `ticket.md > state` =
  `implemented` with history — *initial*
  (`implementation-started`, `implementation-completed`) or *resume*
  (`implementation-resumed`, `implementation-completed`).
- **Blocked behavior:** if work cannot continue (scope creep / unsafe / unclear),
  keep state = `implementation-in-progress`, set `status: blocked`, and record in
  `implement.md`: blocking reason, partial changes, recommended next action, and
  whether plan revision is required. Do **not** set `implemented` (IM-10). The
  ticket is then recoverable by re-running `/implement` (resume) or revising via
  `/plan`.
- **Stop / block conditions (do NOT mutate):** state ∉ {`approved`,
  `implementation-in-progress`}; (initial) review not APPROVED / `dev_new` dirty /
  branch exists; (resume) expected branch missing or not checked out; `plan.md`
  ambiguous; a high-risk path (`project-config.yaml > high_risk_paths`) while mode ≠ `high_risk`.
- **Guarantees:** never creates a second branch on resume; never modifies files
  not listed in `plan.md`; **never commits**; never pushes; never advances past
  `implemented`.
- **State transitions:** *initial* `approved` → `implementation-in-progress` →
  `implemented`; *resume* `implementation-in-progress` → `implemented` (owned by
  `/implement`). `implemented → verified → closed` is owned by `/verify`.

### /verify  (review gate)
- **Purpose:** Validate AC coverage and implementation evidence (read-only),
  author `verify.md`, and close on PASSED or block on FAILED. Last command;
  owns success-closure.
- **Inputs:** `<ticket>`.
- **Outputs:** `verify.md` (AC→test→result table, commands+output, high-risk-impact
  statement, sign-off); `ticket.md` updated per outcome.
- **Preconditions:** `ticket.md` exists; state = `implemented`; `spec.md` has AC
  IDs (TR-1); `implement.md` present with evidence (files + commits, IM-6).
- **Verification depth (MO-6):** `all-ac` (standard) / `all-ac` + rollback
  rehearsal (high_risk). (`smoke` is reserved for the deferred fast mode.)
- **Validation profiles (config-driven; VP-1..VP-5 / ADR-006):** if `plan.md`
  names a profile, `/verify` resolves **profile → checks → commands** from
  `project-config.yaml`, executes them locally (deterministic, non-interactive,
  read-only), and records command, exit code, output summary, and result mapped to
  `AC-n`. No profile ⇒ unchanged behavior. Local only — no GitHub/CI-CD/MCP/
  external runner.
- **Postconditions:**
  - **PASSED** (every AC mapped to a passing result + reviewer sign-off): `ticket.md`
    `implemented → verified → closed` (history `verification-passed`,
    `ticket-closed`).
  - **FAILED** (any AC fails / evidence insufficient): `ticket.md`
    `implemented → implementation-in-progress`, `status: blocked` (history
    `verification-failed`); failures documented in `verify.md`. **Not closed.**
- **Stop conditions / failure:** state ≠ `implemented`; missing AC mapping;
  `implement.md` missing. **On precondition failure, write nothing** (atomic).
- **Guarantees:** does **not** modify implementation files and **creates no
  commit** (validation is read-only); writes confined to `verify.md` +
  `ticket.md`.
- **State transitions (owned by `/verify`):** PASSED `implemented → verified →
  closed`; FAILED `implemented → implementation-in-progress` (rework, recoverable
  via `/implement` resume).

### Manual delivery (after `/verify` closes the ticket)

Delivery to GitHub is **manual** — there is no delivery command, no `gh` CLI, and
no helper script. It is **orthogonal to the state machine**: it performs no state
transition, is not a gate, and is not one of the seven lifecycle stages. GitHub
is a delivery surface only; `ticket.md` stays canonical (ADR-003).

After `/verify` closes the ticket, the developer delivers by hand:
1. `git add <the implemented files> .claude/_specs/<slug>/` (stage explicit paths only).
2. `git diff --cached --name-status` (confirm the staged set — nothing unrelated).
3. `git commit -m "<type>(<area>): <summary>"`.
4. `git push -u origin ticket/<slug>`.
5. Open the Pull Request on GitHub's web UI (base branch `dev_new`), then paste the
   PR URL into `ticket.md > links.github`.

The `links.github` metadata field is filled **manually** by the developer after
opening the PR (no command writes it). Delivery performs no workflow-state
transition and appends no state-history entry.

## 2. Canonical workflow state machine

`blocked` is **not** a state; it is an orthogonal flag (`status: blocked`) on any
non-terminal state. The ticket states are:

| State                        | Allowed next states                                                       | Forbidden (examples)                              |
|------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `draft`                      | `ready-for-research`, `closed`                                            | anything past research; `approved`, `implemented` |
| `ready-for-research`         | `research-complete`, `closed`                                            | `approved`, `implemented`, `verified`, `plan-complete` (fast deferred) |
| `research-complete`          | `spec-complete`, `research-complete` (re-run), `closed`                   | `approved`, `implemented`                          |
| `spec-complete`              | `plan-complete`, `research-complete` (back), `closed`                     | `approved` (skips plan), `implemented`            |
| `plan-complete`              | `approved`, `plan-complete`/`spec-complete` (changes), `closed` (reject)  | `implementation-in-progress` (skips approval)     |
| `approved`                   | `implementation-in-progress`, `plan-complete` (revoke), `closed`         | `verified` (skips implement)                       |
| `implementation-in-progress` | `implemented`, `closed` (abort)                                          | `verified`, `approved` (backwards)                |
| `implemented`                | `verified`, `implementation-in-progress` (rework), `closed`              | `approved`, `plan-complete` (backwards)           |
| `verified`                   | `closed`, `implementation-in-progress` (late rework)                     | `approved`, `draft` (backwards)                   |
| `closed`                     | — (terminal)                                                              | **all** — reopen forbidden; open a new ticket     |

Key invariant: the only path into `implementation-in-progress` is from
`approved`. There is no way to reach implementation without passing the
`/review` gate, in any mode.

---

## 3. Branch strategy

- **When created:** **after review-gate approval only.** `/start-ticket` does **not**
  create a branch. The branch is created when the ticket enters implementation —
  i.e. by the future implementation-entry command, once state = `approved`.
- **Naming convention:** `ticket/<slug>` (slug = the filesystem-safe ticket
  slug). One branch per ticket holds the implementation work.
- **When committed:** `/implement` applies changes to the working tree on the
  branch but does **not** commit; the developer commits **manually at delivery**
  (no command creates a commit). Between `/implement` and manual delivery the work
  lives uncommitted on the branch.
- **When forbidden:**
  - `/start-ticket` creating a branch (workspace setup is branch-free).
  - Any branch creation while the ticket is **not READY** / before state `approved`.
  - A branch for that slug already exists (collision).
  - Base `dev_new` is dirty (uncommitted changes) at branch-creation time.
    (This repo has **no `main` branch** — `dev_new` is the base branch, see
    `project-config.yaml > project.base_branch`.)
  - Branching to modify a high-risk path (`project-config.yaml > high_risk_paths`) unless the ticket is `HIGH_RISK` with
    explicit review-gate context.
- **Rationale:** The non-mutating stages (`intake → research → spec → plan →
  review`) only produce documentation and need no isolated branch. Deferring
  branch creation until `approved` means no branch ever exists for a ticket that
  was never approved, keeping the branch namespace clean and tying every branch
  to a reviewed, implementation-bound change.

---

## 4. Workflow mode behavior

**v1 modes: `standard` and `high_risk` only.** `fast` is deferred (shown for
reference; not selectable in v1).

| Aspect            | STANDARD                       | HIGH_RISK                                            | FAST *(deferred)* |
|-------------------|--------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| Required commands | all 7                          | all 7                                                | start-ticket, plan, review, implement, verify |
| Approval          | `/review` (one reviewer)       | `/review` (one reviewer, **never the author**)       | `/review` required |
| Verification      | every AC mapped to a result    | every AC + **rollback rehearsal** + mandatory ADR    | smoke check |
| ADR               | optional (record if notable)   | **mandatory**                                        | optional |
| Eligibility       | normal work (incl. feature-local BLoCs) | auth/session & token storage, api-network + `ServerName`, composition-root & `main.dart` ordered init, persisted hydrated-BLoC state shape, calls/push, wallet/order money, config-secrets, or generated-code changes; registering a new **app-wide** BLoC; irreversible or wide-blast-radius work | single-file/docs, reversible |

In all modes the `/review` gate is mandatory and never skipped.

---

## 5. Command interactions (expected behavior)

| Question                                   | Behavior                                                                                 |
|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Can `/research` run twice?                 | Yes, while state is `ready-for-research`/`research-complete` (idempotent, re-derives `research.md`). Forbidden once `approved` — must revoke review first. |
| Can `/spec` run before `/research`?        | No — precondition is `ready-for-research` (research must have run). (FAST is deferred in v1.) |
| Can `/verify` run without `/implement`?    | No. Precondition is state `implemented`; from any earlier state it is rejected.          |
| Can `/review` reject an already-approved plan? | Yes, **only** before `implementation-in-progress`: a re-review may move `approved` → `plan-complete` (CHANGES_REQUESTED) or `closed` (REJECTED). Once implementation has started, review is locked until implement is aborted. |
| Can `/start-ticket` run twice for a slug?  | No — slug collision is a stop condition (idempotent guard).                              |
| Can `/plan` run before `/spec`?            | No — `/plan` requires `research-complete` (produced by `/spec`). (FAST is deferred in v1.) |
| Can `/implement` run before `/review`?     | No — precondition is `approved`; this is the core gate.                                  |
| Can a closed ticket be reopened?           | No — `closed` is terminal. Open a new ticket.                                            |

---

## 6. Next-step guidance contract

Every command (all seven lifecycle stages) must, on
completion, emit **next-step guidance** so the operator always knows what comes
next (AC-1). The guidance is a short, standardized block with these fields (AC-2):

| Field | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| **Current state** | `ticket.md > state` after this command. |
| **Next command** | The next legal command in the workflow, or `none` when the state is terminal. |
| **Required actions** | Manual actions that MUST happen before the next command can run (e.g. mark intake `READY`, supply a reviewer). `none` if there are none. |
| **Optional actions** | Useful-but-optional actions available now (e.g. manual delivery to GitHub after closure). `none` if there are none. |
| **Terminal?** | `yes — no further workflow action required` when the state is terminal (`closed`); otherwise `no`. |

Outcome-specific wording:
- **Blocked outcomes (AC-3)** — when a command blocks (`status: blocked`, e.g.
  `/implement` blocked or `/verify` FAILED), the **Required actions** field MUST
  state exactly what has to be completed before the workflow can continue, not a
  generic message.
- **Terminal outcomes (AC-4)** — when the outcome is terminal (`/verify`
  PASSED → `closed`, or `/review` REJECTED → `closed`), **Next command** is
  `none` and **Terminal?** states that no further workflow action is required.

The guidance is presentation/usability only: it is derived from the canonical
state machine (§2) and never itself changes state. Each command's "Next step"
section fills this contract for its own outcomes. (Validation: NS-1..NS-4.)

## Reconciliation status (resolved in the consolidation phase)

The items previously flagged here have been reconciled — this document and
`.claude/project-config.yaml` are now consistent:

1. **State machine — RESOLVED.** `project-config.yaml > lifecycle` now defines
   this exact 10-state machine (with `blocked` as an orthogonal flag) as the
   single source of truth. §2 here mirrors it.
2. **Modes — RESOLVED.** `project-config.yaml > modes` defines `standard` and
   `high_risk` (v1) with approvals/ADR/verification fields matching §4 here.
   `fast` is deferred (not in v1). Identifiers are lowercase; STANDARD/HIGH_RISK
   are display labels.
3. **Closure — RESOLVED.** One closure strategy: no `/close` command; the reviewer
   transitions `verified → closed` at `/verify` sign-off
   (`project-config.yaml > closure`).

# Validation Model — Engineering Workflow v1

> **One validation model for the whole workflow.** Every command MUST run the
> relevant rules below and MUST NOT invent its own validation logic. This model
> is **derived from** (never contradicts) the canonical sources:
> `.claude/project-config.yaml` (state machine, modes, closure),
> `.claude/rules/workflow-rules.md` (gates/guardrails), and
> `.claude/docs/command-architecture.md` (command contracts).
>
> This phase defines the model only. **No automation/validator code is created.**

## Result model

- Each rule evaluates to `PASS` or a **violation** `{ code, severity, message }`.
- **Severity:** `ERROR` blocks the command (it must abort and report);
  `WARN` is advisory (command may proceed, must surface it).
- A command may perform its action only if **no `ERROR` violations** remain
  across its applicable rule set.
- Validation runs at two points per command: **precondition** (before acting)
  and **postcondition** (after writing its artifact / making changes).

## Rule catalogue

### FM — Front-matter (every artifact)
| Code | Severity | Condition |
|------|----------|-----------|
| FM-1 | ERROR | All keys present: `ticket, stage, mode, status, owner, updated, links`. |
| FM-2 | ERROR | `stage` ∈ canonical stages **and** equals the artifact's own stage. |
| FM-3 | ERROR | `mode` ∈ {`standard`, `high_risk`} in v1. `fast` is deferred and must be rejected (e.g. at `/start-ticket`). |
| FM-4 | ERROR | `status` ∈ {`not_started`, `in_progress`, `blocked`, `complete`}. |
| FM-5 | ERROR | `ticket` matches slug pattern `^[A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9._-]*$`. |
| FM-6 | WARN  | `updated` is an ISO date `YYYY-MM-DD`. |
| FM-7 | WARN  | `links` contains `clickup` and `github` keys (values may be empty). |
| FM-8 | ERROR | `mode` is identical across all artifacts of the same ticket. |

### TS — Ticket state source (ADR-003)
| Code | Severity | Condition |
|------|----------|-----------|
| TS-1 | ERROR | Ticket state is read **only** from `.claude/_specs/<ticket>/ticket.md > state`. Inferring state from artifact existence/content is forbidden. |
| TS-2 | ERROR | `ticket.md` exists and its front-matter has all required fields (`ticket, title, mode, state, status, owner, created_at, updated_at`). |
| TS-3 | ERROR | `ticket.md > state` ∈ canonical states; `ticket.md > status` ∈ {`active`, `blocked`}. |
| TS-4 | ERROR | A transition updates `ticket.md` (`state`, `updated_at`) — the single write point. |
| TS-5 | WARN  | `ticket.md > mode/owner` agree with artifact front-matter (ticket.md is canonical; artifacts mirror). |

### ST — State machine
> The "current state" in every ST rule is `.claude/_specs/<ticket>/ticket.md > state` (TS-1).

| Code | Severity | Condition |
|------|----------|-----------|
| ST-1 | ERROR | Current ticket state (`ticket.md > state`) ∈ canonical states (`project-config.yaml > lifecycle.states`). |
| ST-2 | ERROR | A state **change** must target a state ∈ `allowed[current]`. A command that does **not** change state (idempotent re-run, `/plan` revision, `/research` refresh, `/implement` resume/block) is exempt — it appends history without a transition. Anything else is forbidden. |
| ST-3 | ERROR | No stage advances while `ticket.md > status: blocked`. The ticket must first be unblocked (e.g. `/implement` resume resets `status: active`). |
| ST-4 | ERROR | No transition originates from `closed` (terminal). |
| ST-5 | ERROR | `implementation-in-progress` is reachable only from `approved` (initial implementation) or from `implemented` / `verified` (rework after a failed `/verify`). No other source. |

### MO — Modes
| Code | Severity | Condition |
|------|----------|-----------|
| MO-1 | ERROR | The command's stage ∈ `modes[mode].stages`. **v1 supports `standard` and `high_risk` only** (all seven stages); `fast` is deferred — `/start-ticket` rejects `mode: fast`. |
| MO-2 | — | *Reserved.* Fast-mode eligibility checks are deferred with fast mode; not evaluated in v1. |
| MO-3 | ERROR | Any change touching a high-risk path (`project-config.yaml > high_risk_paths`) — or any change to authentication/session, wallet/order money integrity, hydrated BLoC state shape, or `main.dart` init order — requires `mode: high_risk`. |
| MO-4 | ERROR | Approval count satisfied before `/implement`: `modes[mode].approvals` (standard = 1, high_risk = 1), read from `review.md > Approvals`. |
| MO-5 | ERROR | `high_risk` requires an ADR referenced in `review.md > ADR reference`, recorded at `/review` APPROVED (RV-6). |
| MO-6 | ERROR | Verification depth matches `modes[mode].verification` (`smoke` / `all-ac` / `all-ac+rollback`). |

### CMD — Command pre/postconditions
The authoritative pre/postconditions are in `command-architecture.md §1`. The
validator enforces them as state checks (mapping in "Invocation map" below).
| Code | Severity | Condition |
|------|----------|-----------|
| CMD-1 | ERROR | Command's documented **precondition state** equals the current state. |
| CMD-2 | ERROR | After the command, state equals one of the command's documented postcondition states. A command may have multiple outcome states (e.g. `/review` → {`approved`, `closed`, `spec-complete`}; `/verify` → {`closed`, `implementation-in-progress`}). |
| CMD-3 | ERROR | `/start-ticket` only: slug has no existing workspace dir. (No branch is created or checked at start-ticket.) |

### GU — Guardrails
| Code | Severity | Condition |
|------|----------|-----------|
| GU-1 | ERROR | Non-mutating stages (`research`, `spec`, `plan`, `review`) produced no diff outside `.claude/_specs/<ticket>/`. |
| GU-2 | ERROR | No high-risk-path (`project-config.yaml > high_risk_paths`) modification — nor any change to authentication/session, wallet/order money integrity, hydrated BLoC state shape, or `main.dart` init order — unless `mode: high_risk` and approved at the review gate. |
| GU-3 | ERROR | A command writes only inside `.claude/_specs/<ticket>/` (and, for `/implement`, the approved files on branch `ticket/<slug>`). |
| GU-4 | ERROR | Branches are created only by the implementation-entry command (after state = `approved`), named `ticket/<slug>`, from clean `dev_new`. `/start-ticket` must NOT create a branch, and no branch may exist for a not-yet-approved ticket. |

### RS — Research artifact (`/research`)
| Code | Severity | Condition |
|------|----------|-----------|
| RS-1 | ERROR | `research.md` lists relevant directories. |
| RS-2 | ERROR | `research.md` lists relevant config files. |
| RS-3 | ERROR | `research.md` lists possibly affected services and available test/validation commands. |
| RS-4 | ERROR | `research.md` documents risks/unknowns. |
| RS-5 | ERROR | `research.md` documents open questions. |
| RS-6 | ERROR | On success `/research` updates `ticket.md` exactly once (TS-4): `state draft → ready-for-research`, bump `updated_at`, append a state-history entry. Writes confined to `ticket.md` + `research.md`; repository investigation stays read-only. |
| RS-7 | ERROR | Precondition: state = `draft` and `intake.md` Readiness Status = `READY`. |
| RS-8 | ERROR | **Atomicity:** on any precondition/validation failure, `/research` writes nothing — neither `ticket.md` nor `research.md`. |

### SP — Specification artifact (`/spec`)
| Code | Severity | Condition |
|------|----------|-----------|
| SP-1 | ERROR | `spec.md` states a Business Goal and a User Story. |
| SP-2 | ERROR | `spec.md` lists Functional Requirements and Non-Functional Requirements (+ Constraints). |
| SP-3 | ERROR | Acceptance criteria have stable IDs (`AC-n`) and each maps to a requirement (extends TR-1). |
| SP-4 | ERROR | `spec.md` contains **no implementation detail** — no file paths, no code, no approach/steps. (Implementation planning belongs to `/plan`.) |
| SP-5 | ERROR | `spec.md` declares Out of Scope. |
| SP-6 | ERROR | On success `/spec` updates `ticket.md` exactly once (TS-4): `state → research-complete`, bump `updated_at`, append a state-history entry. Writes confined to `ticket.md` + `spec.md`. |
| SP-7 | ERROR | Precondition: `research.md` exists and satisfies RS-1..RS-5, and state = `ready-for-research`, before `/spec` proceeds. |
| SP-8 | ERROR | **Atomicity:** on any precondition/validation failure, `/spec` writes nothing — neither `ticket.md` nor `spec.md`. |

### PL — Plan artifact (`/plan`)
| Code | Severity | Condition |
|------|----------|-----------|
| PL-1 | ERROR | `plan.md` states an Approach. |
| PL-2 | ERROR | `plan.md` lists Steps. |
| PL-3 | ERROR | `plan.md` lists Files to change. |
| PL-4 | ERROR | `plan.md` states a Validation strategy and a Rollback. |
| PL-5 | ERROR | `plan.md` declares Out of scope. |
| PL-6 | ERROR | On success `/plan` updates `ticket.md` exactly once (TS-4): *initial* `research-complete → spec-complete` (history `spec-validated`); *revision* keeps `spec-complete` (history `plan-revised`, reset `status: blocked → active`). Bump `updated_at`. Writes confined to `plan.md` + `ticket.md`. |
| PL-7 | ERROR | Precondition (exactly one entry mode), with `spec.md` satisfying SP-1..SP-5 + TR-1: *initial* state = `research-complete`; OR *revision* state = `spec-complete` AND `review.md` Decision = `CHANGES_REQUESTED`. |
| PL-8 | ERROR | **Atomicity:** on any precondition/validation failure, `/plan` writes nothing — neither `ticket.md` nor `plan.md`. |
| PL-9 | ERROR | `/plan` does **not** approve implementation (no `→ approved`) and does **not** create a branch. |
| PL-10 | ERROR | Revision re-run must address `review.md > Required Follow-up Actions` in the rewritten `plan.md`. |

### RV — Review artifact (`/review`, review gate)
| Code | Severity | Condition |
|------|----------|-----------|
| RV-1 | ERROR | `review.md` exists (written for every decision). |
| RV-2 | ERROR | Decision ∈ {`APPROVED`, `CHANGES_REQUESTED`, `REJECTED`}. |
| RV-3 | ERROR | `APPROVED` requires `plan.md` satisfies PL-1..PL-5 and plan↔REQ/AC traceability. |
| RV-4 | ERROR | `APPROVED` updates `ticket.md` to `approved` (TS-4): `spec-complete → plan-complete → approved`, bump `updated_at`, append history (`plan-validated`, `plan-approved`). |
| RV-5 | ERROR | `high_risk` + `APPROVED` requires one approver recorded in `review.md > Approvals`, who must not be the plan author (RA-3). |
| RV-6 | ERROR | `high_risk` + `APPROVED` requires an ADR reference in `review.md > ADR reference`. |
| RV-7 | ERROR | `CHANGES_REQUESTED` and `REJECTED` must **not** advance to `approved`. `CHANGES_REQUESTED` keeps `state = spec-complete`; `REJECTED` advances to `closed` (RV-10). |
| RV-8 | ERROR | **Atomicity:** if required validation fails, nothing is written (neither `review.md` nor `ticket.md`). |
| RV-9 | ERROR | `/review` never creates a branch and performs no implementation. |
| RV-10 | ERROR | `REJECTED` updates `ticket.md` (TS-4): `spec-complete → closed` (terminal), bump `updated_at`, append history (`plan-rejected`); rejection reasons documented in `review.md`. No `/close` command is used. |

### IM — Implementation (`/implement`)
| Code | Severity | Condition |
|------|----------|-----------|
| IM-1 | ERROR | Precondition (entry path): *initial* state = `approved` AND `review.md` Decision = APPROVED; OR *resume* state = `implementation-in-progress`. Any other state blocks. |
| IM-2 | ERROR | `plan.md` complete (PL-1..PL-5) with an explicit, unambiguous "Files to change" list. |
| IM-3 | ERROR | *Initial path:* branch `ticket/<slug>` is created here (GU-4), from clean `dev_new`, only after approval; no pre-existing branch. |
| IM-3a | ERROR | *Resume path:* the `ticket/<slug>` branch already exists and is checked out; `/implement` must **not** create a second branch. |
| IM-4 | ERROR | Changes are confined to files listed in `plan.md` "Files to change". **No unrelated file is modified** (no silent scope creep). |
| IM-5 | ERROR | A high-risk path (`project-config.yaml > high_risk_paths`) is modified only if `ticket.md > mode` = `high_risk` (else GU-2 blocks). |
| IM-6 | ERROR | `implement.md` records files changed, deviations, and validation run. **No commit is created at `/implement`** (IM-9); commit SHAs are therefore not recorded here — the delivery commit is created **manually by the developer** at the delivery step (no command creates a commit). |
| IM-7 | ERROR | `state = implemented` requires **all** planned work complete and validation recorded. On completion update `ticket.md` (TS-4), bump `updated_at`, append history: *initial* `implementation-started` then `implementation-completed`; *resume* `implementation-resumed` then `implementation-completed`. |
| IM-8 | ERROR | **Block on unsafe/unclear:** ambiguous plan, scope creep, dirty `dev_new`, branch collision/mismatch, or a high-risk path (`project-config.yaml > high_risk_paths`) without `high_risk` → make NO changes and report. |
| IM-9 | ERROR | `/implement` creates **no commit** and never pushes; changes remain as uncommitted working-tree edits on the local `ticket/<slug>` branch (the delivery commit is created **manually by the developer** at the delivery step — no command creates a commit). It never advances past `implemented`. |
| IM-10 | ERROR | **Blocked is valid but not complete:** if work cannot continue, keep `state = implementation-in-progress`, set `status: blocked`, and `implement.md` records blocking reason + partial changes + recommended next action + whether plan revision is required. Do **not** set `implemented`. |

### VF — Verification (`/verify`, review gate)
| Code | Severity | Condition |
|------|----------|-----------|
| VF-1 | ERROR | `verify.md` exists (written for both PASSED and FAILED outcomes). |
| VF-2 | ERROR | **AC coverage:** every acceptance criterion (`AC-n`) in `spec.md` is mapped to an executed result in `verify.md` (TR-2). |
| VF-3 | ERROR | **Implementation evidence:** `implement.md` records the changed files (and any validation run); `PASSED` requires every AC result to pass. Because `/implement` creates no commit (IM-9), commit SHAs are **not** required evidence — the absence of a commit is expected, not a failure. |
| VF-10 | ERROR | `/verify` creates **no commit** (AC-6); validation is read-only and committing is done **manually by the developer** at the delivery step (no command creates a commit). |
| VF-4 | ERROR | Verification depth matches `ticket.md > mode` (MO-6): `smoke` / `all-ac` / `all-ac` + rollback rehearsal (high_risk). |
| VF-5 | ERROR | **PASSED closes (TS-4):** `implemented → verified → closed`, bump `updated_at`, append history (`verification-passed`, `ticket-closed`). |
| VF-6 | ERROR | **FAILED blocks (TS-4):** `implemented → implementation-in-progress`, `status: blocked`, append history (`verification-failed`); ticket is **not** closed; failures documented in `verify.md`. |
| VF-7 | ERROR | `/verify` does **not** modify implementation files; writes are confined to `verify.md` + `ticket.md` (validation is read-only). |
| VF-8 | ERROR | **Atomicity:** on precondition failure, `/verify` writes nothing. |
| VF-9 | ERROR | `verify.md` records the high-risk-impact yes/no statement (TR-3). |

### CU — ClickUp intake (`/start-ticket`, optional, read-only)
| Code | Severity | Condition |
|------|----------|-----------|
| CU-1 | ERROR | If `clickup_id` is given, `CLICKUP_API_TOKEN` must be set in the environment. |
| CU-2 | ERROR | The read-only fetch (`.claude/scripts/clickup_intake.py <id>`) must succeed (task exists / authorized / reachable). |
| CU-3 | ERROR | ClickUp access is **read-only** — only a `GET` is issued; no write (POST/PUT/DELETE), no status/comment change, no task creation/closure. |
| CU-4 | ERROR | **Atomicity:** if `clickup_id` is given and CU-1/CU-2 fail, `/start-ticket` writes nothing (no workspace created). |
| CU-5 | ERROR | ClickUp seeds only `title`/`description`/`url`; `ticket.md` remains the canonical workflow-state owner (no state derived from ClickUp). |

### VP — Validation profiles (`/plan` selection, `/verify` execution; WF-PILOT-003)
> Applies only when a ticket's `plan.md` Validation strategy names a validation
> profile. Two **separate** concepts in `project-config.yaml`: `validation_checks`
> (definitions — commands) and `validation_profiles` (selection — check-ids only).
> Execution is **local and config-driven**: no GitHub/CI-CD/MCP/external runner.
> Canonical state ownership is unchanged (ADR-003): profiles, checks, and results
> are configuration/records, never workflow state. Decision: ADR-006.

| Code | Severity | Condition |
|------|----------|-----------|
| VP-1 | ERROR | If `plan.md` references a profile, the profile exists in `project-config.yaml > validation_profiles` and **every** check it requires is defined in `validation_checks`. (Enforced at `/plan` and `/verify`.) |
| VP-2 | ERROR | Validation commands are **read-only** w.r.t. implementation files — running them introduces no working-tree change (reinforces VF-7). |
| VP-3 | ERROR | Validation commands are **deterministic and non-interactive** (stable, repeatable result; no prompts or human input). |
| VP-4 | ERROR | **Separation of concepts:** profiles reference only check-ids; commands exist **only** in `validation_checks`. A profile carrying a command string is invalid. |
| VP-5 | ERROR | **Backward compatibility:** when no profile is referenced, `/verify` runs no profile-execution path and behaves exactly as before (config-driven execution is opt-in). |

### RA — Role authority & separation of duties
| Code | Severity | Condition |
|------|----------|-----------|
| RA-1 | ERROR | Gate commands (`/review`, `/verify`) may be invoked **only** by role `reviewer` (`project-config.yaml > role_authority.gate_commands`); author commands by `developer`/`ai_agent`. The workflow never requires Engineering Manager participation per ticket. |
| RA-2 | ERROR | Every recorded actor (`owner`, history `by`) ∈ defined roles {`workflow_owner`, `reviewer`, `developer`, `ai_agent`} (or a named person mapped to one). Legacy `em` maps to `reviewer` (gate) / `workflow_owner` (governance). |
| RA-3 | ERROR | With `separation_of_duties.enabled`, the `reviewer` actor at `/review` and `/verify` must **not** be the author of the plan/implementation under review (no self-approval) — **except** that for `mode: standard` tickets self-review is permitted when `separation_of_duties.allow_self_review.standard: true`. `high_risk` always requires a distinct actor and never self-reviews. |

### TR — Traceability
| Code | Severity | Condition |
|------|----------|-----------|
| TR-1 | ERROR | Every acceptance criterion in `spec.md` has a stable ID (`AC-n`). |
| TR-2 | ERROR | Every `AC-n` is referenced in `verify.md` with a recorded result. |
| TR-3 | ERROR | `verify.md` contains the high-risk-impact yes/no statement: whether the change touched any high-risk path (auth/session & token storage, api-network + `ServerName`, composition-root, hydrated persisted state, calls/push services, wallet/order money, config-secrets, generated-code) or altered authentication/session, wallet/order money integrity, hydrated BLoC state shape, or `main.dart` init order, and if yes that it was intended and approved at the review gate. |

### CL — Closure
| Code | Severity | Condition |
|------|----------|-----------|
| CL-1 | ERROR | `verified → closed` is performed only at `/verify` sign-off by the reviewer. |
| CL-2 | ERROR | No `/close` command exists; closure outside `/verify` is invalid. |

### NS — Next-step guidance (every command; wf-005)
> Usability layer: every command tells the operator what comes next. Guidance is
> **presentation-only** — derived from the §2 state machine (canonical in
> `project-config.yaml > lifecycle`); it never changes or owns state (ADR-003).
> Field definitions: `command-architecture.md §6`. Decision: ADR-008.

| Code | Severity | Condition |
|------|----------|-----------|
| NS-1 | ERROR | Every command — all seven lifecycle stages — emits next-step guidance on completion (AC-1). |
| NS-2 | ERROR | The guidance identifies all five fields: current workflow state; next legal command; required manual actions; optional actions; and the terminal-state condition when applicable (AC-2). |
| NS-3 | ERROR | On a **blocked** outcome (`status: blocked`, e.g. `/implement` blocked or `/verify` FAILED), the required-actions field states exactly what must be completed before the workflow can continue (AC-3) — not a generic message. |
| NS-4 | ERROR | On a **terminal** outcome (`closed`), the guidance sets next command = `none` and states that no further workflow action is required (AC-4). |
| NS-5 | WARN  | Guidance vocabulary/structure is consistent across all commands and agrees with the canonical state machine (usability/NFR). |

## Invocation map (command → applicable rules)

Every command except `/start-ticket` begins by reading `ticket.md` (TS-1..TS-3)
and ends by writing the transition to `ticket.md` (TS-4). `/start-ticket`
**creates** `ticket.md` with `state: draft`. All commands enforce **RA-1/RA-2**
(role authorization); the review gates `/review` and `/verify` additionally enforce
**RA-3** (separation of duties). Every command additionally emits next-step
guidance at completion (**NS-1..NS-4**), so it is not repeated per row below.

| Command        | Precondition rules                          | Postcondition rules                     |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| `/start-ticket`| FM-3, FM-5, CMD-3, GU-4, MO-1, CU-1..CU-5 (if `clickup_id`) | TS-2/3/4, FM-1..FM-8, ST-1, CMD-2 |
| `/research`    | TS-1/2/3, FM-*, ST-1, ST-2, MO-1, CMD-1, RS-7, RS-8 | RS-1..RS-6, TS-4, FM-*, GU-1, GU-3, CMD-2 (state → ready-for-research) |
| `/spec`        | TS-1/2/3, FM-*, ST-1, ST-2, MO-1, CMD-1, SP-7 (RS-1..RS-5), SP-8 | SP-1..SP-6, TR-1, TS-4, FM-*, GU-1, GU-3, CMD-2 (state → research-complete) |
| `/plan`        | TS-1/2/3, FM-*, ST-1, ST-2, MO-1/2, CMD-1, PL-7, PL-8, VP-1/VP-4 (if a profile is named) | PL-1..PL-6, PL-9, PL-10 (revision), TS-4, FM-*, GU-1, GU-3, CMD-2 (state stays/→ spec-complete) |
| `/review`      | TS-1/2/3, FM-*, ST-1, ST-2, CMD-1, RV-2, RV-8 | RV-1, RV-3..RV-7, RV-9, RV-10, TS-4 (APPROVED → approved; REJECTED → closed), FM-*, GU-1, GU-3, CMD-2 |
| `/implement`   | TS-1/2/3, FM-*, ST-2, ST-5, MO-4, CMD-1, IM-1, IM-2, IM-8 | IM-3 or IM-3a, IM-4, IM-5, IM-6, IM-9, then IM-7 (complete → `implemented`) **or** IM-10 (blocked → `implementation-in-progress` + `status: blocked`), TS-4, FM-*, GU-2, GU-3, CMD-2 |
| `/verify`      | TS-1/2/3, FM-*, ST-2, MO-6, CMD-1, VF-8, VP-1 (if a profile is named) | VF-1..VF-4, VF-7, VF-9, VF-10, VP-2..VP-5 (if a profile is named), then VF-5 (PASSED → closed) or VF-6 (FAILED → implementation-in-progress + blocked), TR-2, TR-3, CL-1, TS-4, FM-*, GU-3, CMD-2 |

## Error code conventions

- Codes are stable identifiers (`FM-1`, `ST-2`, …) so command output and logs
  are greppable and consistent across all commands.
- A command reports the **first** `ERROR` per category plus all `WARN`s.

## Out of scope (this phase)

- No validator implementation, scripts, hooks, or commands.
- No changes to high-risk paths.

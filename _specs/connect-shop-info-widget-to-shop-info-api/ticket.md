# Ticket Record — connect-shop-info-widget-to-shop-info-api

> **Keep the front matter free of commentary.** The runtime parses it with a
> standard-library YAML subset reader — it does drop a trailing ` # ...` comment
> correctly, but this file is machine-owned and every field is documented in the
> reference table below. Annotate there, not in the front matter.

> **This file is the single canonical owner of the ticket's workflow state.**
> Its lifecycle position lives in exactly one field: `workflow.current_stage`
> (ADR-018). Stage artifacts (`intake.md` … `verify.md`) never own workflow
> state; their local `status` describes only their own progress. See ADR-003
> (ticket state ownership) in the `wf` plugin's `docs/adr/`.
>
> **Do not hand-edit `workflow.current_stage`, `status`, or `active_blocker_id`
> outside a transition.** They are written only by the step that records an outcome,
> following `rules/lifecycle-protocol.md` §H and §J — one edit, plus one appended
> history entry. Editing them any other way leaves a ticket whose state and history
> disagree, and since 3.0.0 nothing prevents that (ADR-023).

## Field reference

| Field | Required | Purpose | Allowed values |
|-------|----------|---------|----------------|
| `ticket` | yes | Canonical id/slug; ties artifacts + branch together. | slug `^[A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9._-]*$` |
| `title` | yes | Human-readable summary. | free text |
| `workflow.type` | yes | Which workflow this item runs. Chosen once at `/wf:start`; never changes. | `development` \| `study` \| `research` |
| `workflow.version` | yes | Ticket schema version. New tickets are `2`; legacy tickets keep `1` and are normalized in memory, never rewritten on disk (ADR-016). | `1` \| `2` |
| `workflow.current_stage` | yes | **Authoritative** lifecycle position: the stage currently active or due to execute next. There are no pseudo-stages — completion and cancellation live in `status`. | any stage id from the ticket's `workflows/<type>/workflow.yaml` |
| `status` | yes | Orthogonal health and terminal status. | `active` \| `blocked` \| `completed` \| `cancelled` |
| `active_blocker_id` | when blocked | Identity of the blocker halting progress. Set with `status: blocked`; cleared on resume. A resume must present a `ResolutionSignal` carrying this exact id. | e.g. `BLK-ACCESS-01` |
| `owner` | yes | Accountable owner. | `em` \| `developer` \| `ai_agent` \| name |
| `created_at` | yes | Creation date. | `YYYY-MM-DD` |
| `updated_at` | yes | Last transition; bumped on every stage or status change. | `YYYY-MM-DD` |
| `links` | no | Optional delivery links (metadata only; never workflow state). `github` is set by `/publish-pr`. | `{clickup, github}` URLs (may be empty) |

Stage ids and their legal transitions are defined canonically per workflow in
`workflows/<type>/workflow.yaml`. Stage names are domain-specific — `development`
runs `intake → research → spec → plan → review → implement → verify`, while
`study` and `research` have their own topologies.

### Status semantics

| Status | Meaning | Resumable |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| `active` | Work is progressing normally. | — |
| `blocked` | Non-terminal halt. `workflow.current_stage` stays put; transitions report `WORK_ITEM_BLOCKED` until an authorized resume. | yes, via `rules/lifecycle-protocol.md` §J |
| `completed` | Terminal success. `workflow.current_stage` remains the last executed stage. | no (`WORK_ITEM_TERMINAL`) |
| `cancelled` | Terminal rejection. `workflow.current_stage` remains the last executed stage. | no (`WORK_ITEM_TERMINAL`) |

## State History

Append one entry per transition; never edit or remove past entries. The command
recording the outcome writes these — the initial `ticket-created` entry at intake,
and one per transition after that (`rules/lifecycle-protocol.md` §H).

  evidence_ref: >-
    Owner instruction 2026-08-24, verbatim: "work in the same branch so in the
    end i will push all changes". The blocker is cleared by an explicit owner
    decision to accept the mixed diff, NOT by cleaning the tree. IM-3's
    separate ticket/<slug> branch is deliberately waived: work continues on
    ali_dev, and this ticket's changes will ship together with the uncommitted
    dashboard-gallery-page work. Consequences recorded in implement.md >
    Deviations from plan.
